<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> and I mounted a camel and took our last <i>schimmel hauer</i>,
or airing, in Jaffa the beautiful. As our ungainly steed swung up the
road with us on his back, and a peculiarly contemptuous expression on
his face, we became objects of much curiosity to the
natives, who stopped to gaze and point at us. We
were amused to see the women in their excitement
stand with unveiled faces unmindful of the men, who
equally excited had joined them. Their remarks on our
appearance were not exactly complimentary. "Look
at the Frangi ladies, how they sit! How funny they
look! The Frangis are all mad! See, they smile!"
We did not understand Arabic, and our missionary
friend was too kind to translate freely, otherwise we
might not have smiled.</p>

<p>What a glorious morning it was! The remembrance
of it now brings a delicious dreaminess over my senses.
It must have been on such a day that Lothair and the
radiant Mr. Ph&#339;bus journeyed from Jaffa to Jerusalem,
when the lovely Euphrosyne "rode through lanes of
date-bearing palm-trees, and sniffed with her almond-shaped
nostrils the all-pervading fragrance." Sharon,
the great maritime plain, once a huge forest, from which
it takes its name, lay stretched before us. In the midst
of its magnificent orange groves, its flower bedecked
meadows, its peaceful cornfields, rose the stately
palms, their plumed heads nodding in the faint breeze.
Beyond, like an <i>Arabian Nights</i> Geni, the stagnant
clouds rested on the peaks of the Judæan hills, while in
sharp contrast the restless Mediterranean flashed a
thousand brilliant lights. Even the dreaded black
rocks at the entrance of the harbour were robbed of
their terror by the soft sunshine. We were loath,
indeed, to leave so lovely a scene, but we comforted
ourselves with the thought of returning again some day.</p>

<p>An hour after midday we had said good-bye to our
kind hostesses, and seated in a ramshackle old carriage
which threatened to come to pieces at any moment,
were driving&mdash;save the mark!&mdash;in all haste to the
railway station. Our road lay through the market,
whose odoriferous Asiatic smells are particularly unpleasing
to English noses. We thought our driver
divined this, for he wasted no time, but with terrific
shouts and pistol-like cracks of an enormous whip,
scattered to the right and left everything and everybody
in the line of route, and brought us up to the station in
dashing style but exhausted condition.</p>

<p>We had barely got on to the platform with our
luggage when the booking office, as if by magic, was
invaded by a howling screaming pack of men trying to
force their way through a hastily closed door into the
station. The voices of the officials demanding order
were drowned by the noise, but the speedy arrival of a
couple of stalwart Turkish soldiers armed with formidable-looking
whips, which they applied impartially to
the heads and shoulders of the unruly mob, soon
created a dispersion, and peaceable passengers were
allowed to take their tickets. This sudden raid on the
railway station was made by a number of unauthorised
porters, who had become a grave source of annoyance
to travellers. The officials were determined to rid themselves of the
nuisance, and the order of "No admittance" was being put into
effect that day. The Arab seems incapable of learning obedience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
through any medium but that of corporal
punishment. Whether he can be taught
reason by less drastic treatment under a more
reasonable form of government has yet to be
proved. At present, the only law he condescends
to understand is represented in
tangible form by a powerful soldier armed
with a weapon which he promptly uses, indifferent
to life or limb of the offender. This
measure, if not pleasing, is at any rate
effectual.</p>

<p>The railroads from Jaffa to Jerusalem, and
from Beirût to Damascus, are justly considered
to be the most valuable innovation from the
West. The primary idea of the French
Company who work them was, that the
thousands of pilgrims who visit the Holy
Land every year would use the line as a
shorter and less expensive mode of travelling.
The original idea has developed, for the
demands of commerce require goods trains,
and merchants are not slow to avail themselves
of these advantages. Besides this, the
railways have proved a powerful means of
breaking down ancient prejudice and bringing
the larger culture and refinement of the West
within reach of the more ignorant but intelligent
East. We found the train service moderately
good, the officials civil, and the route pleasant
and full of interest. We travelled for the
first few stages in the men's compartment
which was large and airy, built like a modern
tramcar, with an extra seat extending the
whole length of the centre; windows and
door were wide open, the former protected
by blinds, so it was not to be wondered at
that we should prefer this carriage to the
narrow stifling compartment reserved for the
women. The advent of three ladies excited
no comment, for were we not "Frangis"?
And "Frangis" did extraordinary things!
Our fellow-passengers were nearly all Orientals.
Magnificently turbaned and gorgeously dressed
Moslem gentlemen sat side by side with
dirty, travel-stained pilgrims, and dirtier
pedlars from distant lands. Jewish and
Armenian merchants held lively discussions
about the price of stuffs, while two German
colonists discoursed on the approaching visit
of Kaiser William. A wretched, miserably
clad soldier-boy occupied a corner; he was
going to join his regiment, and looked sullen
and downcast. I offered him an orange,
which he accepted, for the day was hot.
I felt sorry for him, poor fellow, for well he
knew that a Turkish soldier's life "is not a
happy one."</p>

<p>Occasionally stray brown locusts flew in
through the door, "flopped" down on the
floor and remained stationary, apparently
dazed with the unusual sight and sound of the
"iron horse" and its long tail.</p>

<p>The arrival of more passengers of the
masculine gender at a roadside station demanded
that we should vacate our seats and
retire to the women's quarter at the other end
of the train. We accomplished our exit with
as good a grace as possible, reflecting that
Eastern customs being the exact reverse of
those practised in England, we would show
our good breeding by yielding to them&mdash;when
there was no other alternative. In
this instance the change was not for the
better. The space was limited, and the air
stifling, but the friendly native ladies made
room for us and offered us a share of the nuts
they were eating, the shells of which plentifully
bestrewed the floor. Miss B., our missionary
friend, and the ladies exchanged lengthy
compliments, inquired minutely into each
other's business and commented upon it, as if
they were members of the same family. We
discovered that these untidy, unshapely-looking
females were the wives of the above mentioned
resplendent Moslem gentlemen. Like good-tempered
children, they seemed absolutely
contented with their nuts and dolls&mdash;for as
such they treated their brown-faced, dark-eyed
babies&mdash;desiring nothing more in this
world than to please their husbands, and to
purchase the latest pattern of <i>maudeel</i>&mdash;or
veil&mdash;imported from Beirût.</p>

<p>We had now passed through the Wady es
Sura and were speeding rapidly through the
Valley of Rephaim, once the way in which
the Philistines used to come up in the days of
the Judges and David. Great rocks lifted
their heads on either side, whose barren wildness
suggested the home of the eagle and
vulture. The sun was setting, and soon a shrill
scream from the engine announced that we
were nearing the end of our journey. We
had just time to collect our wraps when the
train drew up at the little station, and our
ears were assailed with loud cries from the
porters of "Jerusalem!" Before we had
time to think, friendly hands grasped ours,
and the kindly voices of Miss K. and Miss C.
were bidding us welcome.</p>

<p>How delightful it was to escape the noise
and worry of an Oriental railway station! To
know that all our luggage would be sought
for and looked after by a well-trained
servant! To feel that we had no care but to
answer the polite inquiries of our friends!
A few yards and we were crossing the Bethlehem
road on our way to Miss K.'s house,
which was perched on the top of the Mount
of Evil Counsel. The impressions that short
walk left on my mind will never be effaced.
Before us, clothed in the magical light of the
setting sun, rose the mystical blue wall of the
distant Moab Hills, while at their feet the Dead
Sea gleamed like a thin line of quicksilver.
On our left stood Mount Zion, while beyond,
Olivet, "the mount before Jerusalem," crowned
with a white church, looked down on the sun-gilt
walls of the Temple Area. The hum of
the city below, the cry of the shepherd in the
Kedron Gorge as he called his flock home,
and the sharp quick bark of the dog, sounded
indistinct and far away.</p>

<p>I began to realise that we were in Jerusalem,
and felt already the magic of its wondrous
associations. It seemed almost incredible
that we should be calmly gazing upon the
very place where the world's Redeemer had
"suffered and bled and died," and our
thoughts were busy as we passed into Miss
K.'s charming home to receive a second
welcome. After supper Elizabeth and I
slipped out into the garden and stood spell-bound
at the lovely scene which met our
eyes. The sparkling heavens high above us,
the hills round us touched with beauty, while
below, the City of our God lay shrouded in
silver moonlight, like a babe asleep in the
arms of its mother. Involuntarily the words
rose to our lips: "As the mountains are
round about Jerusalem, so is the Lord round
about His people."</p>

<p>The next morning we engaged donkeys,
and with Miss B. for guide and counsellor
rode round the walls of Jerusalem. There
was no magical moonlight to soften and
glorify the ruin and desolation which met
our eye at every stage. Where was the
beautiful city and temple which caused the
stern Titus to weep because he could not save
it? Gone! Buried beneath the seventy feet
of rubbish which one day will be cleared
away. And could that offensive pool, overshadowed
by the public shambles, infested with
scavenger-dogs, be "cool Siloam's shady
rill"? Yes, and the poor little village above
is all that remains of the town of Siloam.
Even the olive-trees added to the dreariness
of the landscape, for they were stunted and
badly nourished. We were now riding up the
Mount of Olives, the very road trodden by the
Man of Sorrows. Loving thoughts and holy
memories gathered round every step of the
way till we reached the top and "beheld the
city." I cannot do better here than quote
from Dr. Macduff's <i>Memories of Olivet</i>. "So
far as the Mount itself is concerned, thousands
of scenes in our own and other lands are alike
grander and more beautiful; there is nothing
conspicuous in height; nothing picturesque in
form, nothing remarkable in colour. An
unconspicuous green swell, with triple top
sprinkled with trees, and crowned with a
Russian church; this, with a walled town
fronting its western slope, studded with a few
domes and minarets, at once and for ever took
its place in the most sacred shrine of memory
as the first view of Jerusalem from the Mount
of Olives." True, there is nothing really
beautiful about Jerusalem, according to our
Western ideas. Its situation is fine, but the
city itself is ugly and surrounded by "mountains"
of rubbish. The Mosque of Omar
occupies the Temple area, and Islam has taken
up its abode in the place once dedicated to
the true worship of Jehovah. But in spite of
its present misfortunes, Jerusalem possesses a
charm for Jew, Christian and Moslem alike,
which no other city in the world can claim.
Coming down from the Mount, we rode
through Bethany, the home of Martha and
Mary. It is a small village, and like many
places in Palestine, disappointing to the
traveller unless he looks away from the present
to the past, and fills in the picture with the
vivid colours of sacred and profane history.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to suppose that the East
never changes. The march of progress has
reached Jerusalem, Western influence is felt
within its walls, as the red roofs of the
numerous Frangi houses and the glass
windows of European shops strongly testify.
Residents told us that the Jerusalem of to-day
bears little or no resemblance to the Jerusalem
of a few years back, except in its natural
features.</p>

<p>The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is the
chief place of interest in Jerusalem. A visit
to its great porch carried us back to the days
of chivalry, when the iron shoes of the
Crusaders clanged on its stone pavement.
Christian knights no longer are required to
fight the Turk for the possession of the Holy
Sepulchre; instead a strong guard of Turkish
soldiers is always on duty to protect the
Christians from the violence of each other.
Fierce fights, and even bloodshed, are not
uncommon among the various sects, Latins,
Greeks, Maronites, Copts, Armenians, etc.,
who have set up their worship in different
parts of the sacred edifice. The Holy
Sepulchre itself is claimed and held by the
Greeks, and every Easter thousands of pilgrims
from all parts of the world worship at its shrine.
We made our way one day with much difficulty
into the narrow cave-like apartment, lighted
with huge wax candles, and filled with adoring
men and women rapturously kissing the stone
slab which covers the supposed tomb, while a
Greek priest stood by to receive the offerings
of the faithful. We were glad to force
our way out, but found some difficulty in
doing so, the pressure of the crowd was so
great.</p>

<p>This Easter there were five thousand
Russians in the city; impassioned-looking
men and women, tall, blue-eyed and well
favoured, they poured in day after day. We
constantly met large parties covered with the
dust of travel, each carrying his beloved tea-kettle
which he filled at a running brook or
neighbouring convent and boiled for his
favourite beverage on the <i>semavar</i>, or copper
charcoal brazier, which a friendly native would
lend. Hundreds of weary miles had they
tramped over the hot sand, under the burning
sun, deterred by no difficulty, but ever keeping
their faces stedfastly set towards Jerusalem.
These Russian peasants have one great object
in life, for which they save and work with an
enthusiasm which never fails: to go on
pilgrimage to the Holy Land, to touch the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span>
Holy Sepulchre, to visit the holy shrines, to
be baptised in the Jordan, and to return to
their fatherland empty in purse but rich in
candles, vials of oil, unleavened cakes blessed
by the Patriarch, and garments dipped in the
Jordan, to be worn only once again&mdash;as
shrouds.</p>

<div class="figcenter w400">

<div class="caption">JERUSALEM AND THE MOUNT OF OLIVES FROM SCOPUS.</div>
</div>

<p>We once witnessed a touching sight in the
Church of the Sepulchre. Four hundred of
these peasants, all middle-aged and very old
men and women, were toiling up the steps to
the tomb, and with looks of rapt devotion
kissing the sacred spots. One aged woman
was carried on the back of her son, who
tenderly kept her from being hurt. We
joined them at their Greek service, and longed
to be able to tell them the Gospel story in all
its sweet simplicity. Their belief seemed to
be a series of superstitions with very little
foundation of truth. We were told that each
pilgrim left with the Patriarch a gold napoleon
(or French pound) as a gift. We often came
across these poor peasants, sometimes in the
convents where they were resting, at others
in their churches, or again in the markets,
and at all times found them courteous and
gentle.</p>

<p>Space would fail, if I chronicled all our
doings, but we were never tired of going into
the town and watching the people. Outside
the Jaffa gate, huddled together in one
undistinguishable mass, were always to be
found camels, donkeys, horses, dogs and
lepers. The last were terrible objects, thrusting
their fingerless hands into the faces of the
passers-by, begging for <i>backsheesh</i>, and drawing
attention to their frightful infirmity. Poor
things, outcasts because of their awful and
mysterious disease! Inside the Jaffa gate,
the bazaars attracted us. The Armenian and
Jewish merchants eagerly drove their bargains
with their equally keen customers, who
unblushingly offered a third or fourth of the
sum first demanded, and seemed to spend a
vast amount of time and talk but very little
money on their purchases.</p>

<p>Mingling with the leisurely crowd of pedestrians,
we noticed several dignified Abyssinians
clad in spotless white robes, their commanding
stature and intelligent ebony faces giving them
a distinguished air which was very remarkable.
Before General Gordon freed them they were
slaves, now they are the "learned men"
among the Moslems, and live within the
precincts of the Mosque of Omar.</p>

<p>The markets were thronged by numbers of
countrywomen, whose dress excited our
admiration, for it was always picturesque and
often beautiful, differing entirely from that of
the townswomen. It consisted of one straight
garment, cut with much simplicity of style
and reaching from the neck to the ankles,
with wide hanging sleeves, which could be
tied back when the wearer was engaged in
household work; the material of which these
dresses were made was sometimes cotton, but
oftener thick native silk, dark blue in colour,
striped with red and yellow (the front or vest
being exquisitely embroidered by the owner's
clever fingers), and secured round the waist
by a handsome silk scarf; over this a smart
scarlet cloth jacket, with half sleeves and of
no particular cut, came to the waist; this also
was elaborately worked. The long embroidered
veil of stout cotton, capable of
holding somewhat heavy purchases, was
thrown over the head leaving the face free,
while heavy silver and gold coins adorned the
neck, arms and forehead. Stockings were
disdained, but the feet were sometimes thrust
into red Turkish slippers, though more often
than not, these impedimenta were dispensed
with. A camel's-hair <i>abbaye</i> or cloak was
sometimes worn for protection against both
extreme heat and cold. The perfect carriage
and fine figures of these women, who are
guiltless of corsets, might well excite the envy
of the fashionable Western lady, as with free
and graceful step they walk barefooted for
miles, carrying on their well-poised heads
heavy water-pots, or baskets filled with
market produce and livestock in the shape
of cocks and hens. To the casual observer
the dresses seem all alike, but a practised eye
can discern at once whether this woman
comes from Nazareth, or that from Bethlehem,
or another from the mountains, by the set of
the veil or the colour of the gown.</p>

<p>The townswomen affect hideous modern
French fashions from Beirût, and cover their
tightly-laced figures with cheap jewellery, never
omitting to pin the tiny watch (which seldom
keeps time) on their bodices. Coloured stockings
of a fearful pattern are worn, with a
charming indifference to neatness, and gay
little satin slippers with high heels, and rather
the worse for wear, are added. For the
street the pink or blue silk dress must be
covered with the universal outdoor mantle,
made on one pattern, but often of rich white
or coloured silk, embroidered in silver or gold.
In shape it is like a very full double petticoat
divided into two equal parts at the waist by a
girdle&mdash;one half forms a skirt and the other is
thrown over the head, making the wearer
appear at the back like a huge animated
cottage loaf. The maudeel covers the face.
Hats are reserved for the heads of foreigners.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> photographic fever burnt fiercely
for the next few weeks. Every spare
hour was devoted to the camera, and
there was not a person in the house
from the Vicar himself to the boy who
came in to clean boots and knives who
had not been pressed to repeated sittings.
There were no more blank plates, but
there were some double ones which had
been twice exposed, and showed such a
kaleidoscope jumble of heads and legs
as was as good as any professional
puzzle; but, besides these, there were a
number of groups where the likenesses
were quite recognisable, though scarcely
flattering enough to be pleasant to the
originals. There was quite a scene in
the dining-room on the evening when
Oswald came down in triumph and
handed round the proofs of the first
presentable group, over which he had
been busy all the afternoon.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh, oh! I'm an old woman,
and I never knew it!" cried Mrs. Asplin,
staring in dismay at the haggard-looking
female who sat in the middle of the
group, with heavy, black shadows on
cheeks and temple. The Vicar cast a
surreptitious glance in the glass above
the sideboard, and tried to straighten
his bent shoulders, while Mellicent's
cheeks grew scarlet with agitation, and
the tears were in her voice, as she
cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"I look like a p&mdash;p&mdash;pig! It's not a
bit like! A nasty, horrid, fat, puffy
pig!"</p>

<p>"I don't care about appearances;
but mine is not in the least like," Esther
said severely. "I am sure no one
could recognise it; I look seventy-eight
at the very least."</p>

<p>Robert flicked the paper across the
table with a contemptuous "Bah!" and
Max laughed in his easy, jolly manner,
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now I know how I shall look when
my brain softens! I'm glad I've seen
it; it will be a lesson to me to take
things easily, and not overstudy."</p>

<p>"But look at the leaves of the ivy,"
protested Oswald, in aggrieved self-vindication,
"each one quite clear and
distinct from the others; it's really an
uncommonly good plate. The detail is
perfect. Look at that little bunch of
flowers at the corner of the bed!" All in
vain, however, did he point out the excellences
of his work. The victims refused
to look at the little bunch of flowers.
Each one was occupied with staring
at his own portrait; the Asplin family
sighing and protesting, and Peggy
placidly poking a pin through the eyes
of the various sitters, and holding the
paper to the light to view the effect. It
was a little trying to the feelings of one
who had taken immense pains over his
work, and had given up a bicycle ride
to sit for a whole afternoon in a chilly
pantry, dabbling in cold water, and
watching over the various processes.
Oswald was ruffled, and showed it more
plainly than was altogether courteous.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry you're not pleased," he
said coldly. "I aim at truthfulness,
you see, and that is what you don't get
in a professional photograph. It's no
good wasting time, simply to get oneself
disliked. I'll go in for nature, and
leave the portrait business to somebody
else. The girls can try! They think
they can do everything!"</p>

<p>Peggy looked at Esther, and Esther
looked at Peggy. They did not say
a word, but a flash of understanding
passed from the brown eyes to the grey,
which meant that they were on their
mettle. They were not going to defend
themselves, but henceforth it was a case
of die, or produce a good photograph,
and so oblige Oswald to alter his tone of
scornful incredulity.</p>

<p>For the next week the camera was the
one engrossing thought. Every minute
that could be spared was devoted to
experiments, so that Fräulein complained
that lessons were suffering in consequence.
The hearts of her pupils were
not in their work, she declared; it would
be a good thing if a rule could be made
that no more photographs were to be
taken until the Christmas holidays. She
looked very fierce and formidable as she
spoke, but soft-hearted Mrs. Asplin put
in a plea for forgiveness.</p>

<p>"Ah, well, then, have patience for a
few days longer," she begged. "They
are just children with a new toy; let
them have as much of it as they will
at first, and they will tire of their own
accord, and settle down to work as
well as ever. We can control their
actions, but not their thoughts; and
I'm afraid if I forbade photography at
present, you would find them no more
interested in lessons. I fancy there is
something especially engrossing on
hand this week, and we might as well
let them have it out."</p>

<p>Even Mrs. Asplin, however, hardly
realised the thoroughness with which
the girls were setting to work to achieve
their end. They held a committee
meeting on Esther's bed, sitting perched
together in attitudes of inelegant comfort,
with arms encircling their knees,
and chins resting on the clasped hands,
wherein it was proposed and seconded
that Peggy, the artistic, should pose
and take the sitters, while Esther, the
accurate, should undertake the after
processes.</p>

<p>"And what am I to do?" cried
Mellicent plaintively, and her elders
smiled upon her with patronising encouragement.</p>

<p>"You shall wash up all the trays and
glasses, and put them neatly away."</p>

<p>"You shall carry the heavy things,
dear, and stand to me for your back
hair. I think I could make a really
good effect with your back hair."
Peggy put her head on one side and
stared at the flaxen mane in speculative
fashion. "A long muslin gown&mdash;a
wreath of flowers&mdash;a bunch of lilies in
your hands! If you weren't so fat, you
would do splendiforously for Ophelia. I
might manage it perhaps if I took you
from the back, with your head turned
over your shoulder, so as to show only
the profile. Like that! Don't move now,
but let me see how you look." She
took Mellicent's head between her
hands as she spoke, wagged it to and
fro, as if it belonged to a marionette,
and then gave a frog-like leap to a
further corner of the bed to study the
effect. "A little more to the right.
Chin higher! Look at the ceiling.
Yes&mdash;es&mdash;I can do it. I see how it can
be done."</p>

<p>It turned out, indeed, that Peggy had
a genius for designing and posing pretty,
graceful pictures. With a few yards of
muslin and a basket or such odds and
ends of rubbish as horrified Esther's tidy
soul to behold, she achieved marvels in
the way of fancy costumes, and transformed
the placid Mellicent into a dozen
different characters: Ophelia, crowned
with flowers; Marguerite, pulling the
petals of a daisy; Hebe, bearing a
basket of fruit on her head, and many
other fanciful impersonations were improvised
and taken before the week was
over. She went about the work in her
usual eager, engrossed, happy-go-lucky
fashion, sticking pins by the dozen into
Mellicent's flesh in the ardour of arrangement,
and often making a really
charming picture, only to spoil it at the
last moment by a careless movement,
which altered the position of the camera,
and so omitted such important details
as the head of the sitter, or left her
squeezed into one corner of the picture,
like a sparrow on the house-top.</p>

<p>Out of a dozen photographs, three,
however, were really remarkable successes;
as pretty pictures as one could
wish to see, and moreover exceedingly
good likenesses of the bonnie little
subject. Esther's part of the work was
performed with her usual conscientious
care; and when the last prints were
mounted, the partners gazed at them
with rapture and pride. They were
exhibited at the dinner-table the same
evening amid a scene of riotous excitement.
The Vicar glowed with pleasure;
Mrs. Asplin called out, "Oh, my baby!
Bless her heart!" and whisked away
two tears of motherly pride. Oswald
was silent and subdued; and even
Robert said, "Humph&mdash;it's not so
bad," a concession which turned the
girls' heads by its wonderful magnanimity.</p>

<p>Their triumph was almost sweeter
than they had expected; but, truth to
tell, they had had too much of photography
during the last week, and Mrs.
Asplin's prophecy came true, inasmuch
as it now ceased to become an occupation
of absorbing interest, and assumed
its rightful place as an amusement to be
enjoyed now and then, as opportunity
afforded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span></p>

<p>By the beginning of October Peggy
had quite settled down in her new home,
and had established her right to be
Arthur Saville's sister by convulsing the
quiet household with her tricks and
capers. She was affectionate, obedient,
and strictly truthful; her prim little
face, grandiose expressions, and merry
ways, made her a favourite with everyone
in the house, from the Vicar, who
loved to converse with her in language
even more high-flown than her own, to
the old, north-country cook, who confided
in the housemaid that she "fair-ly did
love that little thing," and man&#339;uvred
to have apple charlotte for dinner as
often as possible, because the "little
thing" had praised her prowess in that
direction, and commended the charlotte
as a "delicious confection." Mrs.
Asplin was specially tender over the
girl who had been left in her charge,
and in return, Peggy was all that was
sweet and affectionate; vowed that she
could never do enough to repay such
kindness, and immediately fell into a
fresh pickle, and half frightened the life
out of her companions by her hairbreadth
escapes. Her careless, happy-go-lucky
ways seemed all the more
curious because of the almost Quaker-like
neatness of her appearance. Mellicent
was often untidy, and even Esther
had moments of dishevelment, but
Peggy was a dainty little person, whose
hair was always smooth, whose dress well
brushed and natty. Her artistic sense
was too keen to allow of any shortcoming
in this respect, but she seemed blessed
with a capacity of acting before she
thought, which had many disastrous
consequences. She was by no means a
robust girl, and Mrs. Asplin fussed over
her little ailments like an old mother
hen with a delicate nursling. One
prescription after another was unearthed
for her benefit, until the washstand in
her room looked like a small chemist's
shop. An array of doctor's tinctures,
gargles and tonics stood on one side,
while on the other were a number of
home-made concoctions in disused wine
bottles, such as a paregoric cough-mixture,
a hair wash, and a cooling
draught to be taken the first thing in the
morning, which last pretended to be
lemonade, but in reality contained a
number of medicinal powders. "Take it
up tenderly, treat it with care!" was
Peggy's motto with respect to this last
medicine, for she had discovered that by
judicious handling, it was possible to
enjoy a really tasty beverage, and to
leave the sediment untouched at the
bottom of the bottle!</p>

<p>Esther and Mellicent were almost
equally well supplied by their anxious
mother, but their bottles behaved in
a sober, well-regulated fashion, and
never took upon themselves to play
tricks, while those in Peggy's room
seemed infected by the spirit of the
owner, and amused themselves with
seeing how much mischief they could
accomplish. A bottle of ammonia had
been provided as a cure for bites of
gnats and flies; Peggy flicked a towel
more hastily than usual, and down it
went, the contents streaming over the
wood, and splashing on to the wardrobe
near at hand, with the consequence that
every sign of polish was removed, and
replaced by white unsightly stains. The
glass stopper of a smelling-salts bottle
became fixed in its socket, and being
anointed with oil and placed before the
fire to melt, popped out suddenly with
a noise as of a cannon shot, aimed
accurately for the centre of the mirror,
and smashed it into a dozen pieces.
The "safety ink-pot," out of which she
indited her letters to her mother, came
unfastened of its own accord and rolled
up and down the clean white toilet cover.
This, at least, was the impression left
by Peggy's innocent protestations, while
the gas and soap seemed equally obstinate,
the one refusing to be lowered
when she left the room, and the other
insisting upon melting itself to pieces in
her morning bath.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> some respects the result of this competition
has been satisfactory. The competitors
carefully observed the rules, the sewing was
in many cases most excellent, the neatness
and finish conspicuous. Many of the articles
were made so well that we felt quite proud
to think our girls could turn out such good
work.</p>

<p>The care as to details pleased us very much,
for that was given in all but a few exceptions.
It was so nice to see how firmly buttons were
sewn on, button-holes made so well, and
seams carefully overcast or pinked, raw edges
protected by tidy button-hole stitches. Then,
too, we were glad to note, that although
intended for the very poor, the workers had
not fallen into the common error of selecting
ugly materials for their articles. Very few of
the stuffs used were anything but suitable,
serviceable, and pretty rather than not, the
way in which the blouses especially were
made being quite satisfactory.</p>

<p>There were a few carelessly made articles
where bad sewing, most inappropriate trimming&mdash;eminently
one overall with extremely
common imitation fur, the cotton back of
which was visible and very untidy&mdash;disqualified
for prizes or even honourable mention.</p>

<p>We were much disappointed to find that
there were only two flannel petticoats sent in,
and no serge underskirts at all! Certainly the
younger members of our readers have not
shown much interest in the competition.
The two petticoats sent were so good that the
first prize was divided between them.</p>

<p>There were not nearly as many competitors
altogether as we hoped for, and that was the
unsatisfactory part, for really our belief in our
girls' desire to help the poor was very deeply
rooted. We also hoped that more would have
been spurred on by the chance of a prize to
send in some article.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class='ph4'>THE INDUSTRIOUS BEAVER.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> part played by some of the different
species in the animal world (<i>sic</i>), in the development
of our earth and its resources,
cannot be over-estimated. In some parts of
America, for instance, the persistent industry
of beavers in the construction of dams has
rendered fertile whole tracts of prairie land
that were once arid and barren.</p>

<p>In the <i>Castoridae</i>, together with the
squirrels, the beaver family constitute the
group termed <i>Sciuromorpha</i>, a group distinguished
by its members having a special type
of lower jaw structure, and also the same
type of skull structure. The powerful incisor
teeth of the beaver are admirably suited to
the cutting through of small tree stems, of
branches and twigs, whilst its flat and scaly
tail serves as a rudder to a creature that
always makes its home beside or in the midst
of water.</p>

<p>The beaver is as much noted for its sagacity,
and for what nowadays we call "faculty," as
it is prized for its fur. One of the largest of
the rodents, its body measures nearly three
and a half feet in length, not taking the tail
into consideration, which is eleven to twelve
inches in length.</p>

<p>An attempt has been made to acclimatise
the beaver in England again. That it once
bred in our country is proved by the fact that
some fossil remains of the animal have been
obtained from the crag deposits in Norfolk
and Suffolk. These were, however, declared
by Professor Owen to have belonged to a
much larger species of beaver than is now
known. Sir Edmund Loder has a number of
the common species established in a little
valley stream in his estate, Leonard's Lea,
near Horsham, carefully protected, which are
said to be thriving, and Lord Bute had a still
larger number established in Scotland; but it
is not likely that they will ever be at home in
our country again. Whilst badgers and others
have had so much difficulty in holding their
own, it is not likely that the beaver could
breed and thrive unmolested. Whilst writing
the present article, I have heard from Lord
Bute that the last of his beavers died some
time ago.</p>

<p>In other parts of Europe it is found now
only in small numbers, on the banks of the
Danube, the Rhone, and the Weser. In the
northern districts of Canada it is very numerous.
Its range in America is from the
confluence of the Ohio and the Mississippi to
the banks of the Mackenzie River. At one
time the demand for the fur&mdash;greatly in vogue
in those days for men's hats&mdash;was so large
that it was feared this clever little creature
might become extinct, and the noted furriers
of the Hudson Bay Company took measures,
in concert with certain Indian tribes, for its
protection, whilst still procuring large quantities
of its fur.</p>

<p>The most interesting feature in the natural
history of the beaver is their amazing skill in
the construction of their dams and the dwellings
they make for themselves&mdash;"lodges,"
these are called. They are often constructed
in small rivers and creeks where the water is
apt to be drained off, when the supplies are
dried up by winter frost. I spent some time
in Colorado near to a part of the Rockies
where beavers abounded, and where they were
a never-failing source of interest to the young
folks in my friend's family. In Montana also
they abound in vast numbers. One of its
counties is named Beaver Head.</p>

<p>What we&mdash;in our ignorance of the inner life
of those creatures who have always shared the
rich heritage of this world with ourselves&mdash;term
instinct, has taught the beavers to provide
against drought, and to keep up a certain
necessary depth of water, by making a dam
right across these smaller rivers just at what
they know to be a convenient distance from
their houses. The manner in which they
construct this depends on the locality where
they live. If the current is not strong&mdash;if
there is only a slight motion of the water&mdash;the
dam is made almost straight; but in proportion
as the stream is a rapid one, the dam
must be more curved, presenting its convex
side towards the current. Where beavers
have been allowed to build for a long period
undisturbed, their dams become in time,
through the persistent industry with which
they repair them, a bank so solid that it
resists quite a strong on-rush of water or even
of ice. Vegetation plants itself on this&mdash;willows,
birches, and poplar-trees take root.
Sometimes so large a thicket is formed that
birds build there, and the whole makes a
charming colony of happy and busy life. The
dams are built in some rivers of trees which
are often five or six inches in diameter. These
the beaver cuts down with his wonderful sharp
incisor teeth.</p>

<p>In lakes and ponds also the beavers have
their habitat. They like much the narrow
creeks which so often connect the lakes of
North America. The currents help them to
convey the wood and other materials to their
dwellings. A certain depth of water is, of
course, necessary for their purpose. Driftwood
is utilised by them in building, as well
as the green boughs of willows, birches, and
poplars. But mud and stones are used also,
welded all firmly together, and the different
parts of the dam must, of course, be of equal
strength. In the same manner, that is, of the
same materials, they construct their dwellings,
but they are not built with equal care; their
construction is rougher than that of the dams.
The only thing essential in the work is that
they should be made watertight, so that they
may have dry sleeping-quarters. Sometimes
a house is just big enough for one family, but
larger dwellings are also made, such as will
house a great number of animals. When this
is the case, each family has its own apartment,
with a separate door communicating only with
the water, never with the home of any other
family. The wood is laid crosswise, nearly
horizontal, leaving a cavity in the centre.
The smaller branches, that project uselessly,
are cut off with the teeth, and they are
thrown in with the rest to form a good
safeguard against any falling in of the mud
through the roof.</p>

<p>Once it was believed that the woodwork
was first finished, and that then it was
plastered, the tail being used as a trowel for
this purpose. But this was a popular error.
The tail is used as a rudder, and like that of
a dog, is a vehicle for emotion. It is flapped
even when a beaver has been tamed and
domesticated, especially when the creature is
startled. They have a very pretty way of
carrying mud and stones in their little fore-paws,
holding them close up under the throat.
The wood naturally is dragged along, held in
the teeth. All their work is done in the
night-time, a charming sight for a lover of
animals, if he can quietly remain concealed near
enough for observation on a clear calm night.</p>

<p>A wonderful instinct, so-called, again
prompts the beavers to cover their houses
each autumn with fresh mud&mdash;as late in the
season as they can manage it&mdash;so that it may
freeze hard and keep them secure against
their foe, the wolverine, a creature about the
size of our common badger, which is much
about during the winter. Wolverines are
said to do more damage to the fur trade in
smaller animals than all the other creatures of
prey put together.</p>

<p>Their lodges are kept clean, their inhabitants
always plunging into the water instead of
polluting their sleeping quarters.</p>

<p>Sir John Richardson states that their main
food consists of a large root, something like a
cabbage stalk, which grows at the bottom of
lakes and rivers, a yellow water-lily in fact&mdash;<i>Nuphar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span>
luteum</i>. But they eat also the bark of
trees&mdash;that of the poplar, birch and willow.
The latter, however, they cannot procure in
winter, when the ice prevents their getting to
land, so that roots are then their staple food.
In summer the diet is varied by the different
kinds of herbage and the berries growing
near their haunts. In the part of Colorado
I have already referred to, above what is called
Hardscrabble Creek, in Fremont County,
wild fruits, gooseberries, currants, raspberries,
and other berries are in profusion. When
the ice breaks up in the spring, the beavers
always leave their homes to roam about until
the approaching fall of the leaf makes them
return; and after laying in their winter stock
of wood, they then set to work to repair their
homes.</p>

<p>The Indians consider beaver flesh a delicacy,
and they prefer to bake it with the skin on,
as our gipsies roast the hedgehog. It is a
heavy meat, much like pork, hard to digest.</p>

<p>The author already mentioned tamed several
of them, and he got them to answer to their
names and to follow him about like dogs. They
were, he said, very fond of being petted and
fondled, creeping into the laps of the Indian
women and standing on their hind legs to be
caressed. They lived indoors with the women
and children during the winter, and if these
were absent for any length of time, the beavers
quite fretted after them. So domesticated
did they become that they particularly enjoyed
rice and plum pudding, and, indeed, shared
generally the food of the women. The cry of
a beaver cub is very like that of an infant.</p>

<p>The American poet, Whittier, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The musk-rat plied its mason's trade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tier by tier its mud walls laid."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The musk-rat is a small kind of beaver, and
great numbers of the skins are imported into
England. It constructs huts like its larger
relative but of a simpler style, the openings to
them being under the water. There is also
an animal nearly as large as a common beaver
which was included in the same family, and
called a coypu, inhabiting the rivers and
streams of South America. Furs of coypu
are sold as otter skins.</p>

<p>"Ask now the beasts and they shall teach
thee," and from the beaver and its works we
can indeed learn what persistent, cheerful
industry can accomplish. Our poet, Coleridge,
said, "If the idle are described as <i>killing</i> time,
the methodical man may be justly said to call
it into life and moral being, while he makes it
the distinct object not only of the consciousness,
but of the conscience." Perhaps the
latter part of this sentence may seem obscure
to some of you, my readers. To kill time
means evidently to lose all count of it, to be
"unmindful of the fleeting hours." But if
the conscience is roused, and we are imbued
with a sense of our responsibility with regard
to every day, every hour we live, each hour
becomes instinct with possibilities, with the
opportunity and power of developing the gifts
that we have, the talents entrusted to us, not
only with a view to self-improvement and
personal enrichment, but with an eye on
the Master and His work. "Fellow-workers
with Christ" in the redemption of this world,&mdash;how
great a calling!</p>

<p>The beaver's little paws seem so small; yet
by pawful after pawful of earth brought by
these small animals, who are working in
friendly co-operation with their fellows, great
dams that can stem an advancing flood are
constructed.</p>

<p>I once heard a story of a poor and not
over-wise&mdash;as the world counts wisdom&mdash;Highlander.
I think he was a shepherd, he
lived where there were only a few huts widely
scattered over the bleak hillsides, and no
church was within the reach of the inhabitants
of these. God's Spirit moved strongly in the
lonely heart, and he determined that a place
of worship should be built. Every time he
came home to his cot, he brought as many
stones as he could collect whilst out, and he
placed them in a heap not far from his own
door. Those who knew him and who passed
that way jeered and laughed at what the
simple, loving fellow called his church building.</p>

<p>The heap grew, though very slowly; for
many years the shepherd's work went on,
that work which was called by the neighbours
his "folly." But one day a rich stranger
travelling by that lonely and unused way
noticed the heap and asked what it meant.
On hearing its history, his heart was warmed
by the flame of love in that of the poor cotter,
and he caused a good building&mdash;where divine
service was soon held weekly&mdash;to be placed
on the spot, using up in it, let us hope,
those stones which were truly its foundation.</p>

<p>I know, myself, a lovely church, not far
from Ehrenbreitstein on the Rhine, which
was built only from stones brought by loving
hands to ground chosen by the village pastor.
The building took very many years, but it
stands there now complete, a monument of
the free-will offerings and labour of poor
working folks.</p>

<p>We do not all need to think of building
churches, but the stories are typical. We are
all either building, or&mdash;awful thought&mdash;pulling
down the good work of others. As the Book
says, "Every wise woman buildeth her house,
but the foolish plucketh it down with her
hands."</p>

<p>Our power to work increases by use. Many
of the world's greatest books have been
written by busy men. How often, too, one
hears it said that if you want anything special
done you must ask a busy man or woman to do
it. That barren fig-tree to which our Lord
directed the attention of His followers is a
by-word and a proverb for all ages. Persistent
industry it is that meets with the
reward. An abiding sense of duty we need.</p>

<p>Yet all of us have our times of depression,
of weakness, and days when aspiration and
hope seem dead within us. Then let us try
to cast ourselves on Him whose joy, "the joy
of the Lord," may become our strength. One
of our poets says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We cannot kindle when we will<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The fire that in the heart resides;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spirit moveth, and is still,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In mystery the soul abides;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet tasks in hours of insight willed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May be in hours of gloom fulfilled."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is these two last lines I would beg you to
take to heart.</p>

<p>Huber, the distinguished naturalist of
Geneva, who wrote so much and so finely on
bees, was blind from the age of seventeen;
yet he had a passion for the study of animal
and especially of insect life, a study one would
suppose quite out of the reach of the blind.
He had a good and devoted wife, who never
wearied in promoting his well-being and their
joint happiness. Through her eyes he studied
and succeeded in mastering a department in
natural history which needs the clearest and
keenest eyesight. And not only did he write
a great work, which is still referred to as a
masterpiece of its kind, and is still constantly
quoted, but what the wife's eyes saw and
transferred to his brain became his very own,
to dwell upon, to draw deductions from, to
gather to himself a fund of personal happiness,
to give forth again to the world enriched
by his thoughts&mdash;his life made a happiness
and a blessing to himself and others&mdash;all
through the unwearying industry and persevering
efforts of a loving woman who effaced
herself, apparently, for the sake of her husband
and his life's work. "Who would lose his
life shall find it."</p>

<p>A last word. The sovereign remedy for
doubt and perplexity is, "Doe the next
thynge."</p>

<div class="caption">PRINCESS DRESS OF BROWN CLOTH.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first thing on my list with which I must
deal is the recent meeting of the Amateur
Swimming Association, at which the vexed
question of a regulation dress for the women
members was discussed; and there is a good
chance that it will be wisely and properly
decided, so that there will be a regular uniform
dress in future, and all misunderstanding will
be avoided. The material to which the lady
delegates appear to have given in their adhesion,
is stockingette; which they consider
superior in every way to serge, flannel, silk, or
merino. A model costume made of it, shown
by the Birmingham Ladies Club, was so much
approved of by the large assembly of ladies
present, that it was adopted as a guide, the
fullest liberty as to trimmings being given,
while only three colours were allowed, viz.,
navy blue, red, and black. The Birmingham
costume had flat facings of Turkey-red twill,
but of course it is open to any club to select
their own colours. It buttoned on the
shoulders, and by means of gussets under the
arms a short sleeve was formed. The great
recommendation, however, was its cheapness,
as it was announced that it could be produced
in quantities of not less than one
dozen at a fraction over two shillings
each, in the various sizes required by
the wearers. Of course, where there
are so many working women's clubs,
this question of cost is a grave consideration.
The costume finally
recommended was much on this
Birmingham model. With the
additional advice that "it should
reach, at least, to within three
inches from the knee," should
be cut square at the neck, and
button on the shoulder, where
it must be not less than three
inches in width, and where it
must be shaped to the arm
beneath, so as to form a
short sleeve.</p>

<p>Now that swimming as
a pastime has become so
popular amongst women
and girls, and when it
is taught in so many
schools, it is only wise
to decide on a suitable
dress, which can be
modified to meet all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span>
views, and trimmed to please all wearers, and
be attainable to limited purses, and, above
all, should be seemly to wear in a mixed
assemblage of all ages.</p>

<p>Although we have worn the Eton jacket
with more or less decoration for many years,
it seems still to hold its own, and is very
becoming indeed to many people. The same
may be said of the Bolero fronts; both of
these are braided and buttoned this autumn,
and the braiding is generally in panels, while
the buttons most used are of the fancy order.
Basqued bodices, with and without belts,
three-quarter-length coats, quite tight to the
figure, and a coat of the <i>Directoire</i> style,
short at the waist in front, with a rounded
basque, and long coat-tails; all of these are
in fashion, and, so far as I see, though all
have basques, they may be long or short,
according to individual fancy. The great
desire of all women this winter is to present
an appearance of height and thinness, and all
draperies must be sweeping, and the outlines
flowing, to meet with our approval. Flounces
and frills are used with much discretion, so
that they may not contradict the clinging
effect. Skirts are, if possible, tighter than
ever, and only show fulness at the feet, while
as regards our sleeves, the last vestige of
puffiness has deserted them, and not even a
tiny pleat is permitted at the shoulder, and
the whole appearance is that of the old coat-sleeve,
which was originally introduced by the
Princess of Wales.</p>

<p>Of course, with this clinging effect, we may
naturally go on to say that the Princess dress
that was worn by a few people last season will
be adopted by many this winter; and the
newest ones, if in cloth, have very generally
strapped seams; the French Princess gowns
having very generally a <i>plastron</i>, which is
buttoned up on each side with handsome
buttons.</p>

<p>In hats, we find the <i>tre-corne</i> much used in
Paris; but this is a style only suitable to the
very young, or very pretty, so that the wider-brimmed
felts are more generally popular.
Many of the felt hats are made in two colours,
the underpart being of a different colour to
the upper, and very little trimming is used for
them. Low-crowned hats of almost a sailor
shape have been predicted, and the boat shape
is one of the favourite winter models. Quills
and wings have taken the place of the long
and graceful ostrich feathers, the former being
more suitable for winter weather; a large
bow and ends, and jewelled buckles, form
part of the trimming, and the hat-pins are
sumptuously jewelled, and as every lady tries
to select those that are most decorative to her
hat or bonnet, they have become quite a
feature in the head-dress of the day.</p>

<p>I spoke in my last chat on clothes, and
dress in general, of the change that has taken
place in the dressing of the hair, and that it is
worn much lower; in fact, in a coil that lies
on the nape of the neck, the rest of the hair is
waved in large waves, which lie regularly over
the top of the head, and across it from ear to
ear, while the front locks are curled over the
forehead. The chief difficulty presented by
this new departure is in finding a hat or
bonnet to go with it; for all the French
bonnets are made to go with the high rolled
<i>coiffure</i> universally worn on the Continent,
but never very becoming to Englishwomen,
who have good heads of hair and find a
difficulty in producing the tiny knot of hair,
which is the essential part of the high hair-dressing.
The low knot is shown in our
picture of the two figures representing the
new winter gowns, and called "A Princess
dress of brown cloth." These two gowns
show exactly the prevailing styles of the
winter.</p>

<p>I daresay you will have already seen, though
perhaps not quite realised, the change, that
dresses are now worn with bodices of the same
material, and the sketch in question displays
this alteration in style. The seated figure wears
a Princess dress of brown cloth, with revers of
cream-coloured satin, one of which overlaps
the other so far as to close the gown on the
side of the front, and the band of cream satin
is continued across the front and terminates in
a scroll. The satin has a scroll pattern
braided on it with brown silk braid, and the
cuffs are decorated in the same manner. To
those who contemplate having a Princess
gown, I would say, be careful to choose a
good tailor or dressmaker, and a firm material
of which to make your dress, in order to avoid
dissatisfaction with your gown.</p>

<p>The second gown is of green face-cloth.
The bodice and sleeves are tucked with small
horizontal tucks all over them. The skirt is
one of the new ones, and is in three tiers, cut
away from the front, and each is edged with
a small band of chinchilla fur.</p>

<div class="figcenter w350">
<img src="images/i_137.jpg" width="350" height="539" alt="" />
<div class="caption">LONG BASQUED COAT AND EMBROIDERED JACKET.</div>
</div>

<p>The second sketch shows a sac jacket of
smooth blue serge, with a skirt to match.
The jacket is beautifully braided and embroidered
in black, both in front and on the
shoulders. The hat is of blue felt, trimmed
with blue velvet and feathers. The second
figure wears a long basqued coat with a fur
collar, and wide revers in front which taper
down to the waist, and end in two tails. The
cuffs are turned back in the new shape, and
the collar is high and closes in front. The
skirt worn is plain, and is cut in the umbrella
style. The hat is a small velvet one, with fur
trimmings and white or cream lace. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">{138}</a></span>
mixture of lace and fur indeed
with all our winter trimmings this
year is very remarkable, and contributes
to the very light effect of
all the millinery worn.</p>

<div class="figcenter w300">
<img src="images/i_138.jpg" width="300" height="531" alt="" />
<div class="caption">CAPE AND MUFF
OF CHINCHILLA
AND GREEN SILK.</div>
</div>

<p>The pretty sketch next in order
represents a gown made of one of
the new fancy materials trimmed
with chinchilla; cape of chinchilla
trimmed with green silk and cream
lace, and muff to match. The
hat is a very charming model,
which is called by some milliners
a Trelawnley. It droops in front, and is
made of black velvet, round the crown a
very handsome ostrich plume is laid, and
under the brim of the hat is a <i>cache peigne</i> of
pink roses. The new capes of this season are,
many of them, pointed in front and back; and
are often caught in at the waist behind.
Violet cloth has been very much used for
capes, and this is a colour that goes so well
with fur of all kinds that it is likely to be
popular. Where jackets are concerned,
whether long or short in the basques, the
latter must fit very snugly round the hips
without fulness, or they will not give the
effect of the newest style. Many of the
basques are added with a seam just below the
waist, and are marvels of careful fitting.</p>

<p>There is rather a strong tendency to use a
great quantity of orange in the French
millinery; the hue of the moment being of
the reddest and most vivid flame colour.
The other colours in vogue for the same
purpose are green, some shades of red, golden
brown, wallflower, and much blue in all
shades. For capes and coats putty-colour
and fawn are much used, and there is a large
amount of white used for trimming.</p>

<p>I must not finish my chat without mentioning
the ribbon trimmings which have so
largely replaced lace, tulle, and chiffon ruches,
especially upon bodices and blouses. Skirts
as well as bodices are ornamented with
gathered ribbons. The prettiest effect is
given by using two ribbons together, a narrow
and a wider one. These may be of two
different colours, or of black and white, the
latter being placed on the top. Plain bands
of ribbon edged with black velvet, or with
baby ribbon gathered, are also much used;
in fact there seems no style of design which
cannot be turned to account in this decoration.</p>

<p class='center p2'><span class="smcap">Writing History.</span></p>

<p>Some people have very funny ideas about
things. "You know I am supposed to be an
historian," said Kinglake the historian of
the Crimean war when talking to a friend.
"The other day I got a letter which really
touched me: it was signed by two people,
husband and wife, and came from one of our
colonies.</p>

<p>"They described their grief. Their only
child had been killed in the Crimea. For
some incomprehensible reason, they were
most anxious to have their beloved son
mentioned in my history of the Crimean War.</p>

<p>"Surprised, but flattered, I replied by return
of post&mdash;a thing I had not done for
many, many years&mdash;that I should be happy to
do my best for their comfort provided they
sent me the necessary particulars.</p>

<p>"Again, a letter signed by both father and
mother arrived, but with the following cruel
addition&mdash;</p>

<p>"'We have no particulars whatever. He
was killed on the spot like so many others,
and anything you may kindly invent will
be welcome. We leave it entirely to your
judgment.'"</p>


<p class='p2'><span class="smcap">How to Write Well.</span>&mdash;The style of a
writer is a faithful representation of her mind:
therefore, if any girl wishes to write a clear
style, let her first be clear in her thoughts;
and if anyone would write in a noble style, let
her first possess a noble soul.</p>


<p class='p2'><span class="smcap">Knowledge and Love.</span>&mdash;Without knowledge
love is vain, without love knowledge is
vain.</p>


<p class='p2'><span class="smcap">Attend to Small Courtesies.</span>&mdash;No
matter how wise, how clever, how skilled you
may be, if you fail in the small courtesies of
life, people instinctively feel that there is dust
on the balance, and that you do not weigh
as pure gold.</p>


<p class='p2'><span class="smcap">Little Hope for Misers.</span>&mdash;History tells
of illustrious villains; but there never was an
illustrious miser in nature.</p>


<p class='p2'><span class="smcap">Brush it Off, if you Can.</span>&mdash;Stretch
your hand out flat, and place in the middle of
the palm an ordinary coin, a halfpenny, a
penny, a sixpence, a shilling, or anything else.
Then tell someone she can have it, provided
she can brush it off. She must use a common
clothes-brush for the experiment. Your hand
must not be struck, it must be brushed, just
as one would brush a garment. But the coin
will stick to your hand as if it were glued
there. It is a very curious experiment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> subject "Economy" may strike my
readers as being somewhat dry and uninteresting;
but I trust that when I have explained
to you its meaning and shown to what various
things economy can be applied and the good
results attendant on its application, you will
henceforth regard the word with more liking
and comprehension than before.</p>

<p>"Economy" (or "&#339;conomy" as it should
be spelt) comes from the Greek word &#959;&#7984;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#7985;&#945;,
which signifies literally the "administration of
a house or home," and, secondarily, "right
management" or "administration" of anything.</p>

<p>When viewed with regard to our life as a
complete unity, economy, or right administration,
should be zealously practised in three
special ways, namely, economy of money,
economy of time, and economy of forces or
strength, and these last two are touched upon
indirectly in the lines chosen for the heading
of this address.</p>

<p>Let us begin with economy of money.
Many persons, both young and old, learn the
sad necessity for this by hard experience, and
by such my advice is not required. It is
to you, the happy daughters of prosperous
parents, that I should like more particularly to
say a few words on this subject.</p>

<p>There are so many reasons why we should
all practise economy of money, or, in other
words, try to administer our money aright.
Firstly, it trains us in habits of order and
reflection if we try to lay out our money to
the best use instead of squandering it on
worthless trifles which serve only for the
pleasure or amusement of the moment.</p>

<p>Secondly, it sets a good example to those
around us and helps to remind them of the
fact that money like other talents is given to
us to use and not to waste. Thirdly and
chiefly, it is to be commended because if anyone,
no matter who, nor whether his income
be small or large, really administers his money
aright, that person will find himself able to
put by something each year against the rainy
days that may come.</p>

<p>Again, it is not only for one's own use, but
for that of others that we should endeavour to
keep a reserve-fund. And this applies directly
to girls with ample pocket-money. Do begin
now at once; buy a little money-box and every
week or month drop a certain sum into it and
resolve never to open that box except to
relieve some urgent and piteous case of distress.
For years it might remain unopened,
and if you continued to feed it regularly, it
would give you infinite pleasure some day
to be able to open it and with the contents
earn the undying gratitude of a fellow-creature.</p>

<p>If you girls who have now, or will shortly
have, an ample allowance per year to dress on,
were to pause to consider seriously how many
women there are, say in London alone, who
have only £40 or £50 a year, and not a penny
beyond, to live on, that is, to provide them
with a home, food, clothing, firing, and all the
other necessaries of life, there is hardly one
among you probably who would not resolve
to immediately commence administering her
money with some care.</p>

<p>Economy of time again is essential towards
using one's life to the best advantage. It
does not mean a continual bustle and hurry,
but doing things at the right time and working
and living with some definite end in view&mdash;the
final end of all ends being, as the motto
says, the glory and honour of God in our lives.
Again, true economy of time does not imply
that each hour in which we have not actually
achieved some work with brain or hand is
consequently wasted, for it may often be truer
economy to spend an hour in quiet talk with
a friend or in taking suitable recreation, but it
does demand some method in our distribution
of time, and protests against the best hours of
the day being devoted solely to amusement or
to mutually profitless gossip. Milton prettily
says&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hours have wings, fly up to the author
of time and carry news of our usage. All our
prayers cannot entreat one of them either to
return or slacken his pace. The misspents of
every minute are a new record against us in
heaven. Sure if we thought thus, we should
dismiss them with better reports and not
suffer them to fly away empty or laden with
dangerous intelligence. How happy is it
when they carry up not only the message, but
the fruits of good, and stay with the Ancient
of Days to speak for us before His glorious
throne."</p>

<p>Sir James Y. Simpson, the celebrated
surgeon, was very fond of speaking to the
students on the duty of saving the moments
and letting the minutes look after themselves.
But in his estimate, as it should ever be in
ours, the quality of the work was the all-important
element in life. And of a hard-working
thoughtful doctor who died young, he
said, "He was older than some of us who are
twice his age!"</p>

<p>Kingsley had the same thought in his mind
when he wrote those well-known lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Be good, sweet maid, and let who can be clever;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Do lovely things, not dream them, all day long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so make Life, and Death, and that For Ever<br /></span>
<span class="i2">One grand sweet song."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He did not intend to deprecate cleverness and
learning, but to point out that our first endeavour
should be to be good and live a noble
life, and if we could accomplish that, not to
fret or be grieved if outstripped in intellectual
attainments by others; because whilst "to do
lovely things" lies in everybody's power, the
higher intellectual acquirements are not within
the reach of all. With due arrangement of
time it is marvellous how much can be accomplished.
You will be surprised to find how
many books you can read in a year if you
devote one hour a day to them. It is often
said that it is the busiest people who can
always find time to undertake yet some more
work or do a service for others, while idle
people never have time for anything, and the
truth of this paradox is proved by the vast
amount of reading accomplished and the
intense interest taken in extraneous matters
by our very busiest statesmen, surgeons and
clergymen. Try then, all of you, to acquire
such habits of regularity and punctuality
whilst at school, that they may remain with
you afterwards and make it an easy and
pleasant task for you to apportion your time
to the best advantage, when freed from the
rules necessary in scholastic life.</p>

<p>It remains for me to say a few words on
the economy of our powers or strength, which
must be subdivided into physical and moral.
Here the idea of law involved in the word
economy plays a most important part, for
nature has certain laws which, in our employment
of our forces, she will not allow to be
transgressed with impunity; if we overtax
either our bodily or mental strength, we shall
find that this disregard of nature's laws will,
sooner or later, bring its inevitable punishment.
A word of warning against the folly
of taking physical exercise in excess will
hardly be out of season just now, when
bicycling is so very popular, that one unfortunately
hears of many men, women and
girls who have made themselves ill by riding
too fast or too long distances at a stretch, or
who, in other words, have not listened to the
warning of Nature, which says, "Do enough,
but not too much." It is such a pity ever to
convert what is intended to be a beneficent
pleasure into an evil through our inability to
practise a little self-restraint, and this may
arise not only from doing too much, but also
from doing it in a reckless and senseless
manner. I heard it said recently that,
according to computations, there had been
more deaths from bicycling accidents in the
last year in England than there had been
English soldiers killed throughout the present
Egyptian campaign, from its very beginning
to after the Battle of Omdurman; and when
one reads the accounts of these accidents, one
finds that nearly every one was caused directly
by the rider's recklessness and want of
prudence. Too much physical exercise also
weakens our mental powers, so intimately
are mind and body connected, that that is an
additional reason for taking bicycling and all
other bodily exercises in moderation, lest we
should be too tired to fulfil our other duties.
The same warning applies to mental overwork.
How many a girl while at school, and
more especially at College, ruins her eyesight,
if not her constitution, by poring over her
books at all hours, even when she ought to
be taking the much-needed rest of sleep, or of
open-air exercise; and they cannot, or will
not, believe that time spent on necessary
recreation and change of occupation is time
saved, not lost, and will enable them to
resume their work or exercise with far more
vigour.</p>

<p>Therefore, dear girls, listen to your common
sense, and stop immediately when you feel
that, either in work or play, you are getting
overtired.</p>

<p>Finally, let us consider what these three
economies united will effect. Each is good
in itself, but happy is he who practises all
three with the ever-present thought that God
is to be the end of all, for he will be gaining
wisdom, which "is better than rubies," and
"whoso findeth wisdom findeth life, and shall
obtain favour of the Lord." "Wisdom! how
inexhaustible a theme! It is the ripest fruit
of a well-spent life. Wisdom never grows old,
for she is the expression of order itself&mdash;that
is, of the eternal. Only the wise man draws
from life, and from every stage of it, its true
savour, because only he feels the beauty, the
dignity, and the value of life.... To see all
things in God, to make of one's own life a
journey towards the ideal, to live with gratitude
and devoutness, with gentleness and courage,
to add to these the humility which kneels and
the charity which gives, is the true wisdom of
the children of God."</p>

<span class="smalltext">OR,</span><br />
VILLAGE ARCHITECTURE OF BYGONE TIMES.</h2>


<h3>PART II.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> village architecture of England, though
more ancient than that to be found elsewhere
in Europe, does not date so far back as the
ecclesiastical. There are many reasons why
this is the case. The churches and monasteries
were erected with great solidity, because, being
for religious uses, it was presumed that they
would be required for all times, but the more
humble domestic dwellings were rather
constructed with a view to the wants of those
who had to live in them. Then also, the
church was subscribed for not only by those
who lived in the immediate neighbourhood,
but often by the powerful and wealthy, who,
though not being connected directly with the
locality, were moved by charity and generosity
to assist in works of piety.</p>

<p>The cottages in early times were probably
of a very humble character, built of "wattle,"
or osier twigs intertwined like an ordinary
basket, and plastered over with mud or clay.
In eastern countries, Egypt for instance, the
heat of the sun was sufficient to convert this
clay or mud into what is called "crude brick,"
which was very durable, but in England it
required constant renewal, and in the course of
time the wattle rotted away from damp. In
marshy districts the cottages were built of turf
or peat, as is still the case in parts of Ireland
and Scotland. Upon the borders of Staffordshire
and Worcestershire, curious caves are to
be found which are in some cases still inhabited,
and are probably among the earliest human
habitations in this country. Some of the
Derbyshire caves also were converted into
habitations, and many of the holes burrowed
in the cliffs all round our coast were similarly
utilised. In after times they became very convenient
hiding-places for smugglers and their
illicit wares.</p>

<p>It is a singular fact that English school-boys,
and we much fear even girls, take a
delight in digging caves and crawling into
them, and as it requires a good deal of
"wholesome correction" to put a stop to
this dangerous practice, it may be a question
whether there is not some natural or hereditary
instinct which prompts children to work so
hard at this kind of mischief. Of course, the
delightful notion of being a "bold robber," or
a "ferocious bandit," adds some zest to these
very risky operations.</p>

<p>A friend of ours once discovered his children
hard at work at the construction of a cave in
his back garden. They proposed to be a
terror to the neighbourhood, and he told them
all about the shocking things that were done by
robbers who lived in caves, how "they rushed
from their concealed hiding-places and robbed
the unwary traveller," etc. He was met by
the remark, "That is exactly what we
propose to do, pa." "How they stocked the
cave with provisions which they had raided
from law-abiding folks." The chorus came as
before, "That, papa, is what we intend to
do." "At last, my children, they were all
captured, the smaller ones well beaten, and
the older ones hanged." The chorus was far
less jubilant. "Oh, pa, we don't expect that."
"Well, my children," said he, "you must
receive the rewards for your prowess." He
found a few days afterwards that the cave was
completely abandoned.</p>

<p>The earliest cottages or village residences
in England, if we except such buildings
as Winwall and Armenhall in Norfolk, or
Combe Pyne in Devonshire, which are simply
portions of larger buildings converted into
cottages, do not date earlier than the fifteenth
century.</p>

<p>It is somewhat remarkable that the "home
counties" should be richer in village architecture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">{141}</a></span>
than any other part of the country, and it is
not a little singular that many of the best
examples are to be found within a radius of
some thirty miles of the metropolis.</p>

<div class="caption">AT EWHURST, SURREY.</div>
</div>

<p>The beautiful little village of Ewhurst, in
Surrey, contains charming examples, some
dating as early as the sixteenth century.
Ewhurst is now fairly well known to Londoners
who take an interest in beautiful scenery
and picturesque architecture, but thirty years
back was as much a <i>terra incognita</i> as
Dettelbach in Bavaria, where the inn-keeper
told the writer that he had never seen an
Englishman before, and was very much
astonished to find that he did not after all
"differ so very much in appearance from a
German."</p>

<p>The two cottages which we have sketched
at Ewhurst are very characteristic examples
constructed in what is called "post and pan
work." That is to say, the walls consist of a
framework of timber called "post," which is
subdivided into panels called "pan." These
"pans," or panels, are filled in with brick-work.
In the first example the brick is laid in
herring-bone pattern, but in the second
example the whole of the upper storey is
covered with scalloped tiles, a treatment
almost peculiar to Surrey and Sussex. On the
ground floor storey the brick-work between
the timbers is plastered over.</p>

<p>The first cottage, which is of sixteenth
century architecture, has a very prettily arranged
external staircase, protected by the sloping
eaves of the roof.</p>

<p>The second cottage, which is seventeenth
century work, has an unbroken and uninterrupted
roof from end to end, which is the usual
treatment, for it must be pointed out that the
genuine old English cottage does not "break
out all over" in ornamental gables, dormers,
spirelets, finials, and spikes; even when most
picturesque, it is remarkably sober and simple
in outline and is as far as possible removed
from the modern "Bijou cottage," or "Cottage
Ornée," a class of building which is to
architecture what "that pride which apes
humility" is to virtue. The genuine cottage is
the residence of the humble hard-working
peasant, and its picturesque charm springs
from its appropriateness, simplicity, and absence
of fussiness or ostentation.</p>

<p>The first cottage which we illustrate is a
superior building to the second, but it has
a marked sobriety and simplicity about it
which assimilates so well with its humble
surroundings.</p>

<h2><a name="OUR_HERO" id="OUR_HERO">"OUR HERO."</a></h2>

<p class='ph3'>A TALE OF THE FRANCO-ENGLISH WAR NINETY YEARS AGO.</p>

<p class='ph3'><span class="smcap">By</span> AGNES GIBERNE, Author of "Sun, Moon and Stars," "The Girl at the Dower House," etc.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p class='ph4'>SOME ACCOUNT OF ENGLAND'S HERO.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> excuse need hardly be offered for
giving here a few details as to the past
history of General Moore, if only in explanation
of Denham Ivor's supreme
devotion to the man, and of Jack Keene's
more outspoken admiration. Though
Moore's name is inscribed in letters of
blood upon the deathless roll of our
national heroes, not so much is known
about him by people in general as ought
to be known. Ninety years ago a common
mode of referring to him in the
country, and still more in the Army,
seems to have been simply as "Our
Hero." And of this tale John Moore is
the real centre.</p>

<p>In those times of perpetual warfare,
officers often reached high rank early.
In the year 1803 he was still in the prime
of manhood, having been born in 1761.</p>

<p>His father, a Scotch physician of
eminence, and also a very successful
author,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> must have occupied a different
position from that of the average medical
man of those days. He was appointed to
be the guardian and the travelling companion
of the young Duke of Hamilton,
and he showed himself well fitted for the
trust; while his son from the first shone
as a star in whatever circle he might
be placed. The doctor's wife was a
daughter of Professor Simpson, of Glasgow
University. When the doctor
started on a lengthy Continental tour
with his charge, he took also his eldest
son John, then about ten years old, and
the absence lasted nearly five years.
No small trial this to members of a most
affectionate family, but heavy money
losses made it impossible for Dr. Moore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">{142}</a></span>
to give up his charge, even had he
wished to do so.</p>

<p>From boyhood John showed a conscientious
devotion to duty, and a
marked dislike to aught in the shape
of fashionable foppery. Although he
early learnt self-control, he was as a
child very impulsive and hasty-tempered,
and addicted to fighting. At the age of
eleven he narrowly escaped killing a
servant girl through meddling with
loaded pistols; and soon after he received
his accidental injury from the
sword of the Duke, in careless play.
Before this wound was healed, he managed
to get into a smart quarrel with
some French boys in the gardens of the
Tuileries. They, being formally powdered,
frizzled, and attired like grown
men, were disposed to jeer at Jack
Moore's boyish simplicity of dress, and
Jack proceeded promptly to knock them
all down, one upon the top of another.
Since he could box, and they had not
learnt that noble art, they had no chance
against him, and a great outcry was
raised. Dr. Moore, hurrying to the
spot, picked up the fallen, did his best
to comfort them, and severely blamed
his son for lack of politeness, which little
incident gives one a clue to the perfection
of Moore's manners in later life.</p>

<p>By the age of fourteen he was a singularly
fascinating young fellow, with a
face of manly beauty, a daring temper,
and a growing passion for the Army.
Already he had become a good linguist,
and was an adept at both riding and
fencing. About this time when, in the
course of their travels, the three went to
Vienna, the Emperor of Austria definitely
offered to take the brilliant boy into
his service, promising rapid promotion.
But Moore was even then far too ardent
a patriot to serve in any other Army than
that of his own country. The idea was
never for a moment entertained.</p>

<p>It is curious to find him at this date, a
mere lad of fourteen, writing home to
his next brother, Graham, in the style of
a grown man to one far his junior.</p>

<p>"I am pleased, my dear boy, that you
wish to be a sailor, for I am sure you
will be a brave one. I hope that in some
years after this you and I will thresh the
Monsieurs, both by sea and land; but I
hope that we won't make war with the
Spaniards, for the Spanish ambassador
is the best and kindest man I ever saw."</p>

<p>In 1774 Dr. Moore wrote home to his
wife:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was happy to find that you do not
disapprove of Jack's going into the
army. I hope this may turn out well,
because he chooses it, has a turn for it,
and I believe is of a character to make
a good figure as a soldier. He is attentive,
active, and brave; he has great
good sense, will have many accomplishments,
and is the most beautiful and
graceful boy imaginable. It is a very
disputable case whether the Duke of
Hamilton or Jack is the handsomest.
Jack does not stoop as the Duke, but
will have a good carriage, and though
he is so very pretty, he has not the least
tendency to be a coxcomb."</p>

<p>And in another letter, two years later,
occurs a characteristic description of
the boy.</p>

<p>"Jack was as fond as the Duke of
returning to Geneva, and he is much too
strong for me when the Duke is his
second. We were received by our
friends with infinite kindness, and have
been wonderfully feasted. Jack quitted
Geneva a boy, and has returned a man.
Though he has been caressed by all the
high and mighty of the Republic, and is
always invited with the Duke and me,
yet if, at the same time, he has an invitation
from any of his old acquaintances
of a much humbler class, he always
prefers the latter. I pressed him one
day to go with us, because the people
had insisted particularly on his coming.
It was to a fine villa, and a most brilliant
party. I could not prevail; he
silenced me with this sentence: 'They
who have invited me are poor; they were
kind to me when the others did not think
me worth their notice.' Never was a
creature less spoiled than your son by
all the great people who have caressed
him, nor by all the uncommon fine situations<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
he has been in. Though his
manner is manly and noble, yet it is
simple, and he assumes no airs. He is
a charming youth. I wish you had him
in your arms."</p>

<p>At the age of fifteen he was made
Ensign in the 51st Regiment, though he
did not actually join till some months
later. Among the many dangers in his
career was one in those few months,
when paying a visit to Mount Vesuvius.
"Jack" ventured perilously near to the
crater, and in hurrying away he fell and
damaged his knee. A shower of lava
and hot stones poured directly afterwards
upon the spot he had just quitted.
Had Jack Moore's retreat that day been
less prompt, another most famous and
masterly retreat, followed by a never-to-be-forgotten
battle, would not have been
inscribed upon the pages of English
history.</p>

<p>His great friend, Douglas, Duke of
Hamilton, was seized by a passing fit of
military enthusiasm, a few months after
John Moore had joined the 51st, which
in a letter at that date he described as
"one of the best regiments in the service;
as to officers, I never knew such a
number of fine gentlemanly lads. General
Murray told me he did not believe
there was such a corps of officers in the
army; there is no such thing as either
drinking or gambling going on." However,
in 1777 a fresh regiment was raised
for the express purpose that the Duke of
Hamilton might have the pleasure of
commanding it; and though he soon grew
tired of his new vocation, and resigned his
commission, he sent first for his friend
and made him lieutenant and paymaster.
Moore went with the "Hamilton Regiment"
to Nova Scotia, and had some
hard fighting out there, gaining great
credit for personal prowess.</p>

<p>Peace was proclaimed before the close
of 1783 between Great Britain and her then
four enemies: France and Spain, Holland
and the United States. Though Britain
in those days had much less than half
her present population, she was wont
most cheerfully to engage in war with
three or four nations at one and the
same time, apparently without any
serious misgivings as to results.</p>

<p>The "Hamilton Regiment" being
disbanded, Captain Moore, then aged
only twenty-three, went home to live
with his parents in London. He studied
hard, and was much in society, being a
universal favourite. Through the influence
of the Duke of Hamilton, with
whom when possible he always spent
two autumn months, he was chosen to
represent in Parliament four Scottish
boroughs, but it was with the express
stipulation on his part that he should be
in all cases free to follow his own judgment.
He never had been, and he
never became in the true sense a party-man,
but had friends on all sides,
friends who held every variety of political
opinion. Moore fought for country,
not for party.</p>

<p>In 1787 he was appointed Major of a
new battalion at Chatham, and he gladly
forsook civil for military duties. During
the following year he rejoined his first
regiment, the 51st, at Cork, and soon
became Lieutenant-General. While he
was there young Anderson, an Ensign in
his regiment, became one of his most
devotedly-attached friends, and was ever
after his inseparable companion.</p>

<p>By this time he was known as a disciplinarian
of unusual power, indulgent
when he might safely be so, but inflexible
in enforcing strict obedience. In an age
when hard drinking was the fashion, he
set his face like a flint against habits of
intemperance, alike in the ranks and
among officers, from most of whom he
had steady support. One young lieutenant,
who ventured to appear on parade
in a state of intoxication, was forced by
him to resign the service, and from that
time Moore had no further trouble. His
regiment became widely known for its
exceptional sobriety and dependableness.</p>

<p>In 1792 he was ordered to Malta, and
two years later he was fighting with the
French in Corsica, the peace having
already come to an end. On the 10th
of July ended successfully the siege of
Calvi, that being the last spot in the
island which the French had managed
so far to keep. As Moore was gallantly
storming the breach he had a severe
wound, a fragment of shell striking him
on the head. For an instant he was
stunned; but regaining sense, he once
more sprang up the breach. Sir Charles
Stuart, chief-in-command, looking
anxiously on, was alarmed at the bursting
of shells among the assailants. He
rushed forward and dashed over intervening
obstacles, to find Moore in the
midst of shouting grenadiers, his face
streaming with blood. Apparently the
great dread of Sir Charles had been
that he was killed, for in the excitement
of the moment he caught him in his
arms, hardly able to utter his thankfulness,
not only that the breach was won,
but that John Moore still lived.</p>

<p>Two years later a collision between
the English viceroy of Corsica, Sir
Gilbert Elliot, and Sir Charles Stuart,
made the latter resign his command and
return to England; and later Moore was
sharply ordered home by Elliot, who
seems to have been annoyed with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">{143}</a></span>
friendship between him and the leading
Corsican patriots. Moore, on reaching
England, protested with much heat
against the way in which he had been
treated. He had, however, no need
to disquiet himself. The King and
the Duke of York took the matter up,
promoted him to the rank of Brigadier-General,
and sent him out to the
West Indies, there to serve under Abercrombie.
Both the Duke of York and
Pitt had been, from the time of his seat
in Parliament, his personal friends.
Wherever he went he made friends
for life.</p>

<p>While he was in the West Indies,
Denham Ivor, then a young subaltern
of eighteen, was first thrown under
the fascinating influence of Moore,
having been for years one of his
warmest admirers. As usual, numberless
opportunities occurred for the
display of personal bravery, in which
Moore always shone. On one occasion
he had a most narrow escape. At the
storming of the all but impregnable fortification
of Morne Fortuné in St. Lucia,
as he led a desperate charge against the
French, shouting till nearly voiceless,
"Forward, forward! We have almost
gained the heights!" a musket was
aimed point-blank at him. One half
second more, and Moore's career would
have been ended; but a private grenadier,
seeing his peril, flung himself between,
received the bullet meant for him, and
was caught in Moore's arms as he fell
dead.</p>

<p>Ivor too had won laurels and promotion
in those days of hard fighting.
Moore's influence over the younger
officers was unrivalled; and many a one
besides Ivor could look back, long years
after, with the knowledge that John
Moore had been the making of him, not
only as a soldier, but as a man. Moore
shaped the characters of those with
whom he had to do.</p>

<p>Somewhat later, when St. Lucia had
been wrested from the French, he was
appointed Commandant and Governor of
the island; no easy post, for the negroes
had revolted, in imitation of the recent
French Revolution, and they were fearfully
cruel and barbarous in their
methods of warfare. Abercrombie kept
Moore there, long after the latter had, on
account of illness, begged to be released
from the charge, because he knew of
no other man capable of taking his
place.</p>

<p>While striving to put down the rebels,
or "brigands," as they were called,
Moore had a dangerous attack of fever.
On his recovery from it and from a severe
relapse, he was again hard at work,
rising at six in the morning and often
undertaking a thirty-miles march in the
day, till again laid low with a desperate
attack of yellow fever, which all but
carried him off. But for the devotion of
Anderson and of his own French servant
François,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> he could not possibly have
struggled through. Then, with broken
health, he was ordered home; and he
reached London a mere wreck of his
old self.</p>

this offer would suit "Harebell," of about the

ease and would like to improve herself by correspondence.

<p class='center'><span class="smcap">To the Competitors.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> much pleasure in stating that I have
found the mass of the "Miniature Tales"
good. They show an intimate and intelligent
acquaintance with the incidents of "A
Penniless Pair," and have, for the most part,
a distinct perception of its salient points.
Indeed, the general merit of the papers has
rendered it difficult to award the prizes and to
note the instances where the writer deserves
special commendation. I should like to
praise everybody and to thank each and all
for proving themselves (with hardly an exception)
free from erratic spelling and bad
grammar. May I call their attention to the
fact that the rule of the competition is to
summarise the story within a certain compass,
and that any infringement of the rule ought
to disqualify the competitors. Now it is not
abiding by the rule to unfold the sheet of
paper so as to represent one sheet which in
reality makes two; neither is it in strict
accordance with the spirit of the rule to write
in such very small characters as to squeeze
into one page the material for two.</p>

<p>I cannot finish these brief remarks without
drawing attention to the three papers from
foreign sources&mdash;two from France and one
from Roumania. One of these papers exceeds
the space allowed, but in other respects, as
the work of non-English students, the whole
three deserve cordial praise.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
